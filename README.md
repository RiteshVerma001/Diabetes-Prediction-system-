# Diabetes-Prediction-system-
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various health metrics. The model was trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains 768 samples with 8 medical features and a binary outcome (1 for diabetic, 0 for non-diabetic).The model is trained on various types of patients body parameters like Insulin level, Blood glucose level, BMI level etc. Once the trained on input data then we can feed unseen data to the our system and our system predicts whether a patients has diabetes or not based on input data feed to the system.

This system is achieved 78.8% accuracy on training data and 76.6% accuracy on test data.
🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used
Python – Used for implementing the entire machine learning pipeline.
Pandas – For loading and processing the dataset.
NumPy – For efficient mathematical operations.
Scikit-learn – For SVM implementation, data splitting, scaling, and evaluation metrics.
Matplotlib / Seaborn – For visualizing data trends and insights.

📂 Files Used
diabetes.csv – Contains anonymized patient data, including features like:
Dibetes Predection using ml:Main Notebook


Outcome (0 or 1 indicating diabetes status)

🌍 Real-World Applications
Hospitals and Clinics – Can use such models as a decision-support tool to screen patients.
Healthcare Apps – Integrate prediction capabilities for early warning and risk assessment.
Public Health Research – Enables scalable analysis of diabetes prevalence and risk factors.
